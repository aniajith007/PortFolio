The React.js frontend delivers a dynamic and interactive user interface, displaying key OEE indicators like Availability, Performance, and Quality. The Flask API acts as the backend, handling data requests, processing machine metrics, and integrating with databases or other systems. This setup allows users to monitor equipment efficiency, identify bottlenecks, and improve productivity through a seamless, responsive dashboard experience.",

YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, version 8) is a fast, accurate, and efficient deep learning model for detecting objects in images or video streams. React handles the frontend UI, where the live video stream is displayed, and Socket.IO enables real-time, bidirectional communication between the client and server. The server processes the video frames with YOLOv8, detects objects in real time, and sends detection results back to the React frontend for display, creating an interactive and responsive user experience.",

Node.js handles backend functionality, including routing and API integration, while MongoDB stores project details, contact information, and user data securely",
